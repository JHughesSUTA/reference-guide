these are rules of thumb - not absolute


rem vs em 
- rem is relative to the root element (html), usually defaults to 16px, adapts to users preferences/settings

font-size: rem;

width: percentage + max-width, 
--ch units are also good (one ch is roughly equal to the width of a zero in any font)
--ie max width 45ch is roughly 45 characters per line

height: try to use min height instead of height, percentage, rem or viewportheight are okay

padding/margin: em or rem -- depends on if want it to adjust to elements font size then use em.

media-queries: can use ems if not pixels
